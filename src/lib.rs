//! Watchexec: the library
//!
//! This is the library version of the CLI tool [watchexec]. The tool is
//! implemented with this library, but the purpose of the watchexec project is
//! to deliver the CLI tool, instead of focusing on the library interface first
//! and foremost. **For this reason, semver guarantees do _not_ apply to this
//! library.** Please use exact version matching, as this API may break even
//! between patch point releases. This policy may change in the future.
